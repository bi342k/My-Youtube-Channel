# MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL

This is BACKEND and FRONT for my video channel

- [My model](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html)

Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.

…or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# myrepo" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git branch -m master main
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/bi342k/My-Youtube-Channel
…or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/bi342k/My-Youtube-Channel
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
git commit -a -m "merge"
git push -u origin main
…or import code from another repository

You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
